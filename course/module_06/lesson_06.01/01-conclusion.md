## You beat the course!

**First, congratulations!**

You have used the most recent and advanced features of Next.js, Server Actions, React Server Components and revalidation!

Even better, you have learnt how to combine them to craft new patterns like client-server relaying, and overall create an extremely scalable and yet dynamic ecommerce application!

Modern website development has a lot to do with keeping up with the latest technologies and learning how to effectively use them. 

## The Power of Static Rendering

Static rendering has been pushed to its limit in this course due to its speed and cost-effectiveness. 

It is arguably the fastest and cheapest way to deliver a website. Therefore, it is worthwhile to utilize it to the maximum to provide the best possible user experience. 

Contrary to popular opinion, we have learnt that using static rendering can accomodate personalization or up-to-date values. 

This doesn't mean that static rendering should be the only technique you use; but rather that we can keep a website static for a very long time until there is a genuine need for client-side or dynamic rendering.

## Interactivity in a static page with Client-Server Relaying

Mixing static and client-side rendering can create a seamless relay between the client and server values. For instance, we can introduce interactivity in the pre-order section of an e-commerce application, allowing real-time updates. 

A good method to achieve continuous updates is to use polling, which makes it possible for the current user to see updates triggered by other users.

## Partial Prerendering and Next.js Server Features

Next.js's upcoming version offers Partial Prerendering (PPR), which permits us to display user-specific data in a component without making the whole page dynamic. 

This way, costly rendering and data-fetching methods can be limited to specific components, leaving the rest of the page static, hence cheaper and faster.

## Next.js, the Server way
In this course, we have used Next.js server features quite extensively. However, it's important to note that this isn't obligatory.

There are plenty of other React technologies available and it's absolutely valid to use any client-side JavaScript to render your application.

While server-side rendering (static or dynamic) is excellent for content-rich applications like blogs, press websites, or personal websites, client-side rendering is more suitable for software as a service ("SaaS") applications, which are more interactive. 

Modern frameworks allow single-page applications to be quite performant by using code splitting to simulate having multiple pages in terms of performance, while still sticking to client-side rendering.

The choice between server-side static rendering and client-side rendering heavily depends on the nature of the application being built. 

Knowledge of both techniques, with a good understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, is indispensable in the field of web development.
